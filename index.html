      <p>[Pilot]: Hello there </p>
      <p>[Control]: Greetings, Pilot! Read you loud and clear.</p>
      <p>[Pilot]: There is someone on board, they're trying to take over the ship</p>
      <p>[Control]: Be brave! You got this! I think I heard them shout that they will give up if you give a pair of those plastic wings</p>
      <p>[Pilot]: I'd rather die</p>
      <p>[Control]: This is getting dark - lets get off of the merry-go-round and find another ride.</p>
